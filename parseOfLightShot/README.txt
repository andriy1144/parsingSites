A little history:
LightShot is one of the good tools to take a screenshot of the screen. But the key point of this site is that people's screenshots will be published on the site of the same tool. I was bored and decided to look at screenshots of different people, because it's always interesting what you meet here. So that's a little story of how I came up with the idea to create this code
=====================================================================================
HOW TO USE IT:
You need to have link like that:
https://prnt.sc/pt411
----------------pt411 - this is a unique identifier for each image
So the code will parse the image and change the number. When it reaches 1000, you need to select this number to the starting position (it is better to put it above 150) and change the first two letters as well.
That is all what you have to do SOMETIMES, other acts, code will it do by it self
