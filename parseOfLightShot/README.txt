A little history:
LightShot is one of the good tools to take a screenshot of the screen. But the key point of this site is that people's screenshots will be published on the site of the same tool. I was bored and decided to look at screenshots of different people, because it's always interesting what you meet here. So that's a little story of how I came up with the idea to create this code
=====================================================================================
HOW TO USE IT:
First of all you need to go on this page: https://prnt.sc/
Next click on one of this links:

you will be transferred to one of the screenshots and you should copy these letters:

Put these letters here:

Next choose the start position of parsing (it is better to put number which is close to number of the link in the last screenshot), and the finish position(must be bigger than start number)

And the start the code!
